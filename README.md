This repository contains two Streamlit-based applications that use Google's Generative AI (Gemini) model. These apps demonstrate how to interact with the Gemini Pro model using text and image inputs.


## App 1: Text-based Q&A

**File Name:** `app.py`

This application allows users to enter a question and receive a response generated by the Gemini Pro model.

### Features
- Simple input text box.
- On button click, sends the question to Gemini API.
- Displays generated response.

### How It Works
1. User inputs a question in a text box.
2. The application sends the question to the Gemini model using `generate_content()`.
3. Gemini returns a response which is displayed on the screen.

## App 2: Image + Text Analysis

**File Name:** `vision.py`

This application lets users upload an image and optionally enter a text prompt. The Gemini model generates a response based on the image and prompt.

### Features
- Upload `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` image.
- Optional text prompt input.
- Displays the uploaded image and generated response.

### How It Works
1. User uploads an image.
2. Optionally, the user enters a text prompt.
3. Both inputs are sent to the Gemini model using `generate_content()`.
4. Gemini generates a response which is shown on the screen.
